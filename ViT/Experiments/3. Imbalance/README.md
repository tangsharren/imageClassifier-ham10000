To address the data imbalance problem:
1. **Data Augmentation Experiment:**
- Apply data augmentation techniques to the optimal dataset.
- Train models with augmented data and compare performance with models trained without augmentation.

2. **Class Weighting Experiment:**
- Apply balanced class weights to the optimal dataset.
- Train models with class weighting and compare performance with models without weighting.
