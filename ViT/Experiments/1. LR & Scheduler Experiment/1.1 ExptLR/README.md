1. **Initial Learning Rate Experiment:**

Train ViT model separately with initial learning rates of **0.0001, 0.001, and 0.01** using the original dataset.

Utilize a Cosine learning rate scheduler during training.

Plot validation performance against learning rates to identify the optimal initial learning rate.

In the end, 0.0001 is the optimal learning rate
