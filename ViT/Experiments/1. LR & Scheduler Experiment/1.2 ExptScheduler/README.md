 **Scheduler Comparison Experiment:**

Train models using different schedulers **(Cosine with Warmup, Cosine with Restarts, StepLR, ReduceLRonPlateau)** with the optimal initial learning rate

Compare validation performance by plotting against learning rates for each scheduler.

In the end, Cosine with Warmup is the optimal scheduler.
